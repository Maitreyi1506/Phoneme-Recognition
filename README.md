# Phoneme-Recognition

The Indian Phoneme Recognition Project aims to develop robust machine learning models capable of accurately recognizing phonemes in various Indian languages. Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language that distinguish one word from another. Recognizing phonemes is crucial for tasks such as speech recognition, language identification, and natural language processing.

Indian languages are diverse, with each language having its own set of phonemes and pronunciation characteristics. This project addresses the challenge of phoneme recognition across multiple Indian languages, including but not limited to Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada, and Malayalam.

By successfully recognizing phonemes in Indian languages, this project aims to facilitate the development of more inclusive and accurate speech technologies for the diverse linguistic landscape of India. The applications of this project range from voice-enabled interfaces and virtual assistants to educational tools and accessibility aids for speech-impaired individuals.
